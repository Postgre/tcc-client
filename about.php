                        <h3>THE CHRISTMAS CAROLERS</h3>
                        <span>Did you know that most offices in the US will have a corporate Christmas party?</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, Inc., a global outplacement consultancy firm, found that this
                        year
                        alone, more than 80 percent of companies will partake in yuletide festivities.</p>

                    <p>Planning these parties can be a hassle. They quickly become expensive, as bands and other
                        entertainers demand huge paydays.</p>

                        <h3>we believe in doing things differently</h3>
                        <span>Founded in 1996, we offer affordable holiday entertainment at real-time rates for your corporate Christmas party or event. </span>
                    </div>

                    <p>You can expect superior quality when you hire the Christmas Carolers. We cherry-pick our talented
                        singers from music schools across the country. All our carolers are dressed in
                        professionally-designed and award-winning Victorian-styled costumes that invoke the spirit of
                        the season. Our carolers certainly know how to stand out in a crowd!</p>

                    <p>Per hour, we charge $100 to $200 for each caroler. We find that most of our customers order
                        quartets for their corporate Christmas parties, which include a four-piece soprano, alto, tenor,
                        and bass (SATB).</p>

                    <p>The Christmas Carolers won&#x2019;t just stay in one spot all night (unless you want them to!),
                        but
                        rather move naturally through the room to entertain all guests and get them in the Christmas
                        spirit.
                        &#x200B;
                        Our carolers sing a cappella, which means without music. They&#x2019;ll perform your favorite
                        holiday
                        tunes, including the classics that bring back memories of Christmases of yore. At the Christmas
                        Carolers, all our performers are part of the National Carolers Association so you know you&#x2019;re
                        getting the best entertainment for your money. </p>
